## How to use the library?
- Using Compose
  Just use the `OtpView` composable function where you need to display the view
```kotlin
 OtpView(
    otpText = otpValue,
    onOtpTextChange = {
    otpValue = it
    },
    type = OTP_VIEW_TYPE_NONE,
    password = true,
    containerSize = 48.dp,
    passwordChar = "‚Ä¢",
    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Number),
    charColor = Color.White
)
```
Next in your code create `OtpView` composable function like below:
```kotlin
fun OtpView(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    otpText: String = "",
    charColor: Color = Color.Black,
    charBackground: Color = Color.Transparent,
    charSize: TextUnit = 16.sp,
    strokeColor: Color = Color.Black,
    containerSize: Dp = charSize.value.dp * 2,
    otpCount: Int = 4,
    type: Int = OTP_VIEW_TYPE_UNDERLINE,
    enabled: Boolean = true,
    password: Boolean = false,
    passwordChar: String = "",
    keyboardOptions: KeyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Number),
    onOtpTextChange: (String) -> Unit
)
```
